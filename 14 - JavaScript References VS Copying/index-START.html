    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let name = 'Boris' ;
    let name2 = name ;
    console.log({name}, {name2});
    name = 'bori';
    console.log({name}, {name2});
    let age = 100 ;
    let age2 = age ;
    console.log({age}, {age2});

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players ;
    console.log({players},{team});
    console.warn('copia fallida!');

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team.push('Eduardo');
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log({players},{team});
    console.warn('copia fallida!');
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2.push('roberto');
    console.log({players},{team2});

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3.push('rodolfo');
    console.log({players},{team3});

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[5] = 'gustav';
    team5[5] = 'not gustav';
    console.log({players},{team4},{team5});
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Boris Vigotskij',
      age: 247
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person ;
    captain.number = 99 ;
    console.log({person},{captain});
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person , { otherNumber: 65 });
    console.log({person},{captain},{captain2});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // ya funciona :3
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log({captain3});



    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
